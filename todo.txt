Part 1 schematics:
Schematic updates: set ALUOp as 3 bit signal
traces for each instruction type: note each trace in seperate pdf


Part 2 coding:
control unit - lalo
alu control unit - max; done?
branch/jump control - vedaant
one hot instruction format before immediate - max; done?
hart.v connections
divide into pipelining:
    instruction fetch (IF.v)
    decode (ID.v)
    execute (EX.v)
    mem access (MEM.v)
    write back (WB.v)

part 3 synthesis:
everything!
